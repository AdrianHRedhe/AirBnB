# AirBnB
A quick project on AirBnB data.

The dataset is found here: https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data

This is a quick EDA as well as a quick classification model based on description, neighbourhood and room type. The classes are chosen as different price ranges based on the percentiles of the prices.

Disclaimer: This is not how i would usually go about making a model or doing EDA, just showing my familiarity with some packages and concepts as well as giving a quick overview of my programming style. There are therefore some things done ad hoc such as choosing the intervals for the different price classes.
